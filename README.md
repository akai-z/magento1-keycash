# KeyCash `[ABANDONED]`

## `Code needs lots of refactoring and improvement.`

KeyCash is a service that supports cash on delivery (COD) orders in emerging markets.

COD is a popular alternative to credit card payments for e-commerce shopping.  
And it's popular in Asia, Africa and East Europe.

COD orders are higher risk for merchants,  
because orders may be rejected upon delivery wasting time and money.

That's where KeyCash comes in.

## What is this module for?

The module's main functionality is to integrate Magento with KeyCash service,  
in order to verify sales orders through it.

Thus, keeping merchants informed about their COD orders, and whether they  
should comfortably proceed with delivering them.
